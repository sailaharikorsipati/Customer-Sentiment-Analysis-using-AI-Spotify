🚀 Project Overview

Spotify users share thousands of unfiltered opinions on Reddit every day. Traditional survey methods often miss these raw signals. This project leverages Generative AI + Reddit data to capture, analyze, and present consumer sentiment in real time.

With this tool, strategy teams can:

Detect emerging pain points (e.g., UI frustrations).

Amplify strengths (e.g., Spotify Connect being highly praised).

Track sentiment trends over time after product launches or pricing changes.

Directly ask questions in plain English and get AI-grounded answers.

✨ Key Features

Sentiment Classification (AI-powered)
Uses GPT models to classify each Reddit comment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative — handling sarcasm, slang, and mixed opinions that keyword-based tools miss.

Ask Questions (RAG-powered Q&A)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lets you query comments directly. Example: “What do users say about playlists?” → returns a concise answer with traceable supporting comments.

Feature-Level Insights

Top Features Sentiment Chart → Weighs mentions by upvotes to highlight what customers care about most.

Feature × Sentiment Matrix → Breaks down likes vs. dislikes for each key feature, surfacing both risks and opportunities.

Sentiment Trend Over Time
Visualizes how customer sentiment evolves monthly. Helps spot spikes around feature rollouts, UI changes, or pricing updates.

AI Summary
Automatically distills hundreds of comments into Likes, Dislikes, and Recommendations, turning raw chatter into an actionable playbook.

Sample Comments (Top by Upvotes)
Surfaces the most influential customer voices, validated by community upvotes.
